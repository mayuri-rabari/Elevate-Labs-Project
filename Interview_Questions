#  Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis
# Additional Interview Preparation

> **1. What is phishing?**  
> A type of cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to steal sensitive information.

> **2. What is email spoofing?**  
> Forging the sender‚Äôs address to look like a trusted contact.

> **3. Why are phishing emails dangerous?**  
> They can trick users into giving up credentials, bank info, or downloading malware.

> **4. What to do if you get one?**  
> Don‚Äôt click. Report it and delete it. If you clicked, change your passwords immediately.
>
5. How can you verify the sender‚Äôs authenticity?
Check the full sender email address (support@msupdate.net) and domain legitimacy ‚Äî it should match the official domain (e.g., @microsoft.com), not a fake like msupdate.net.

6. What tools can analyze email headers?
Tools like MXToolbox, Google Message Header Analyzer, and Microsoft Header Analyzer help identify spoofing and trace the email‚Äôs real source.

7. What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?
Do not click any links, report the email, mark it as phishing, and delete it from your inbox.

8. How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?
They create urgency or fear (e.g., "Your account is suspended") to trick users into clicking malicious links or giving up sensitive information.

---

## 3. What are some common vulnerabilities in personal computers?

- Outdated software or OS versions  
- Weak or default passwords  
- Open or unused ports  
- Unpatched services (e.g., SMB, SSH)  
- Insecure firewall settings  
- Running vulnerable services like Telnet or SMBv1  

---

## 4. How does OpenVAS detect vulnerabilities?

**Answer:**  
OpenVAS detects vulnerabilities by:
- Performing **port scanning** to find open services
- Using **banner grabbing** to detect software versions
- Comparing results with its **Network Vulnerability Tests (NVT)** feed
- Matching known CVEs with services found on the host

---

## 5. What is CVSS?

**Answer:**  
CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a standardized metric system used to assign **severity scores** (0‚Äì10) to vulnerabilities.

| Score Range | Severity |
|-------------|----------|
| 0.0‚Äì3.9     | Low      |
| 4.0‚Äì6.9     | Medium   |
| 7.0‚Äì8.9     | High     |
| 9.0‚Äì10.0    | Critical |

---

## 6. How often should vulnerability scans be performed?

- At least **monthly** for regular systems  
- **Weekly or continuous** for critical infrastructure  
- **After major system changes**, updates, or deployments  

---

## 7. What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?

**Answer:**  
A **false positive** is when a scanner reports a vulnerability that does **not actually exist** or is **not exploitable** in the given context.

---

## 8. How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?

**Answer:**  
Use the following criteria:
- **CVSS Score** (Critical vulnerabilities first)
- **Exploit availability** (Is there a public exploit or POC?)
- **Asset criticality** (e.g., production server vs test PC)
- **Exposure level** (internal vs internet-facing)
- **Functionality impact** (can it disrupt operations?)

---

## 9. What are the limitations of OpenVAS?

- May generate false positives or miss zero-day vulnerabilities  
- Can be time-consuming depending on system complexity  
- Requires frequent NVT feed updates for accuracy  
- Needs careful tuning for optimal performance in large networks  

---

## 10. How would you secure your system after a scan?

**Answer:**
- Apply patches and software updates
- Disable unused services and ports
- Remove vulnerable packages (e.g., SMBv1, Telnet)
- Configure and enable the firewall
- Regularly re-scan to monitor for new threats

# üîê Firewall Interview Questions & Answers  

---

## 1. What is a Firewall?

A **firewall** is a hardware or software security system that acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks. It monitors and filters **incoming and outgoing network traffic** based on defined security rules.

- üîí It allows or blocks specific traffic to protect systems.
- üß± It helps prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.

---

## 2. What is the Difference Between Stateful and Stateless Firewalls?

| Feature                 | Stateless Firewall                     | Stateful Firewall                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Connection Tracking**| ‚ùå Does not track connections           | ‚úÖ Tracks active connections                |
| **Packet Awareness**   | Inspects individual packets            | Inspects packets as part of a session      |
| **Context Awareness**  | No context; each packet handled alone  | Aware of connection history and state      |
| **Performance**        | Faster but less intelligent            | Slightly slower but more secure            |
| **Security**           | Basic filtering                        | Advanced filtering based on behavior       |

---

## 3. What are Inbound and Outbound Rules?

- **Inbound Rules**:  
  Define what kind of **incoming traffic** is allowed or blocked.  
  üîπ Example: Block port 23 to stop Telnet traffic from external systems.

- **Outbound Rules**:  
  Define what kind of **outgoing traffic** is allowed or blocked.  
  üîπ Example: Block access to specific websites or IPs from internal users.

---

## 4. How Does UFW Simplify Firewall Management?

**UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** is a command-line frontend for `iptables` on Linux systems. It simplifies complex firewall configurations using easy-to-understand commands.

- ‚úÖ Human-readable syntax
- ‚úÖ Easy to enable/disable services
- ‚úÖ Suitable for beginners

üìå Examples:
```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw deny 23

## 5. Why Block Port 23 (Telnet)?

Port 23 is used by the **Telnet** protocol, which is a legacy method for remote terminal connections.

- ‚ùå Telnet sends **usernames and passwords in plaintext** over the network.
- üîì It is **vulnerable to packet sniffing** and MITM attacks.
- üß† Attackers use Telnet for:
  - IoT botnets (e.g., Mirai)
  - Exploiting default credentials
- ‚úÖ SSH (Secure Shell) over **port 22** is the modern, encrypted alternative.

üîí **Best Practice**: Block port 23 unless absolutely needed for legacy compatibility (and monitor it aggressively).

---

## 6. What Are Common Firewall Mistakes?

| Mistake | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Allowing All Traffic** | Using `allow any` rules defeats the purpose of a firewall. |
| **2. Misconfigured Priorities** | Incorrect rule ordering can allow unintended access. |
| **3. Ignoring Outbound Rules** | Only configuring inbound filters leaves data exfiltration wide open. |
| **4. Not Blocking Default Services** | Leaving ports like 23, 21, or 3389 open with no authentication. |
| **5. Poor Documentation** | Not keeping track of changes can lead to audit and troubleshooting failures. |

üî• Real-world breaches often involve **misconfigured firewalls** or lack of **segmentation**.

---

## 7. How Does a Firewall Improve Network Security?

A firewall is your **first line of defense** for controlling how devices communicate.

### üîê Key Security Benefits:

- **Access Control**: Define exactly who can talk to what service on what port.
- **Least Privilege Enforcement**: Only necessary traffic is allowed.
- **DDoS & Botnet Mitigation**: Blocks suspicious IPs and malformed traffic.
- **Internal Segmentation**: Prevents lateral movement inside the network.
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Logs help detect unauthorized attempts or insider threats.

‚û°Ô∏è Firewalls are often used alongside:
- IDS/IPS
- VPNs
- Proxies
- Load balancers

---

## 8. What is NAT in Firewalls?

**NAT (Network Address Translation)** is used to **map private internal IP addresses** to a **public IP** for outbound or inbound connections.

### üîÅ Types of NAT:

| Type         | Use Case |
|--------------|----------|
| **SNAT**     | Source NAT - used for **outbound** traffic |
| **DNAT**     | Destination NAT - used for **inbound** traffic |
| **PAT**      | Port Address Translation - maps many private IPs to one public IP using different ports |

### üõ°Ô∏è Why It Matters in Firewalls:

- NAT hides internal network structure
- NAT provides basic **obfuscation/security**
- Used heavily in **home routers**, **enterprise firewalls**, and **cloud gateways**

üìå Firewalls with NAT are often called **stateful firewalls** with NAT capabilities.
